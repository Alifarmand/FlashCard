##### This project is built with create-react-native-app.
It is made for learning purpose as a project for Udacity.
It's a questionnaire game with cards where you can answer and peak the answer while it has a counting system for points. 


* Use NPM or Yarn to get the project running.


## To run the proejct you will need expo or emulators

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. If you have yarn, you know what to do, if not just use the npm commands.


```
git clone https://github.com/Alifarmand/FlashCard.git

yarn / npm i
yarn start / npm start
```

Now scan the QR code in your terminal with the expo app on your phone.
That's it, now you can see the project. PS. I removed redux from the project, due to time limitation and the fact that this project can be done without.


#### Other available commands

`npm test`  

`npm eject`  

`npm run ios`
  
`npm run android`
